Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   8

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:PhysDesignRules:2506 - Incorrect placement for a BUFR component. BUFR adc_dco_bufr in clock region
   CLOCKREGION_X0Y3 is driven by a CCIO adc_dco_in_p in clock region CLOCKREGION_X0Y4. The BUFR should be placed in the
   same clock region as the CCIO or the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint should be used on the net <adc_dco_ibuf_s>. 
ERROR:Pack:1642 - Errors in physical DRC.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.
