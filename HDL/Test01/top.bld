WARNING:ConstraintSystem:119 - Constraint <NET "adc_clock_out" LOC = M22 |>
   [ML605_FMCint_AD9284.ucf(107)]: This constraint cannot be distributed from
   the design objects matching 'NET "adc_clock_out"' because those design
   objects do not contain or drive any instances of the correct type.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem - A target design object for the Locate constraint
   '<NET "adc_clock_out" LOC = M22 |> [ML605_FMCint_AD9284.ucf(107)]' could not
   be found and so the Locate constraint will be removed.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:119 - Constraint <IOSTANDARD = LVCMOS25;>
   [ML605_FMCint_AD9284.ucf(107)]: This constraint cannot be distributed from
   the design objects matching 'NET "adc_clock_out"' because those design
   objects do not contain or drive any instances of the correct type.

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'PIN_SystemClock_200MHz', used in period
   specification 'TS_SystemClock', was traced into MMCM_ADV instance
   MAIN_200_CLK_MMCM. The following new TNM groups and period specifications
   were generated at the MMCM_ADV output(s): 
   CLKOUT0: <TIMESPEC TS_adc_clock_out = PERIOD "adc_clock_out" TS_SystemClock *
   1.25 HIGH 50%>

Done...

INFO:NgdBuild:1222 - Setting CLKIN1_PERIOD attribute associated with MMCM
