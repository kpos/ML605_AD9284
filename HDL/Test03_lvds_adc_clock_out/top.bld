INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'PIN_SystemClock_200MHz', used in period
   specification 'TS_SystemClock', was traced into MMCM_ADV instance
   MAIN_200_CLK_MMCM. The following new TNM groups and period specifications
   were generated at the MMCM_ADV output(s): 
   CLKOUT0: <TIMESPEC TS_CLKOUT0 = PERIOD "CLKOUT0" TS_SystemClock * 1.25 HIGH
   50%>

Done...

INFO:NgdBuild:1222 - Setting CLKIN1_PERIOD attribute associated with MMCM
